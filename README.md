# miniRT_linux

This is a mid-course project at 42 School. The project requires us to build a basic ray tracer.

We had to implement basic shapes like spheres, planes, and cylinders, handle ambient luminosity, lights, and instructions from a file. We also had to implement rotation and translation for all objects and a moving camera.

## Bonus

There were multiple bonus features, including reflection, colored lights, and multiple spotlights.

## Use

This is the linux port.
